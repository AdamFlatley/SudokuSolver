# SudokuSolver
Solves sudoku puzzles
Simple algorithmic sudoku solver in which further practice of C++ object oriented programming is attempted
Number entry can be improved -> find a way to create a GUI? or user interface _WinAPI or PyQT

strong intentions to revisit this and apply some method to extract sudokus from the online website "onlineSudok" and solve them
-> double check if consistently works for all expert level sudokus? written a while ago but some inkling that it only worked 70% of the time.
