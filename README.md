# SudokuSolver
Solves sudoku puzzles
Simple algorithmic sudoku solver in which further practice of C++ object oriented programming is attempted
Number entry can be improved -> find a way to create a GUI? or user interface _WinAPI or PyQT

strong intentions to revisit this and apply some method to extract sudokus from the online website "onlineSudok" and solve them
-> double check if consistently works for all expert level sudokus? written a while ago but some inkling that it only worked 70% of the time.

13/11/2020 Update -> Upon discovering recursion a better method has been found, though it still uses similar principles. Can work through using the algorithm in this program.
Then one can use recursion to test the final empty squares and brute force the answer. (an example of this is uploaded in Python)
